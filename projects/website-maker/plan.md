# Website Maker — Single Source of Truth

## Goal
Launch a multi-tenant, conversion-focused site builder for martial arts gyms with a “Claim this site” flow and integrated CRM/automations.

## Current Status
- MVP stack: GitHub (source), Vercel (frontend), Render (optional backend).
- Copy generator prompt + JSON schema ready.
- Static generator prototype validated offline.

## Next Milestones
1) Connect repo to Vercel and publish Hub.
2) Build Next.js multi-tenant template or connect Webflow CMS.
3) Stripe checkout + onboarding form → flip demo to live.
4) CRM + automations: lead→schedule→show→close tracking.
