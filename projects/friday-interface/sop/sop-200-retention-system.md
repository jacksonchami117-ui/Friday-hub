# SOP‑200 — FRIDAY Retention System

**Purpose**: Keep users engaged, reduce drop‑off, surface wins.

## Lifecycle & Touchpoints
- Day 0–1: guided first-run checklist (Connect Hub → Open Intake → Create Project).
- Weekly: Recent updates panel, nav badges.
- Milestones: first deploy, 10th SOP, 100th run → toast + banner.
- Recovery: Resume Session banner on failures.

## Data & Hooks
Mock now; real later via getRecentDocs/getRuns/getDecisions. Store hasSeenIntro, lastActiveAt.

## UI
EngagementBanner on Dashboard; nav badges for counts.

## QA
Reduced motion bypass; banners focusable; dismiss persists.
